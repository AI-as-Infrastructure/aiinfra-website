## Technical Outputs

AIINFRA will primarily be engaged in non-technical work, but in order to produce high quality non-technical outputs we will be preparing source data, experimenting with commercial and open source tools, and building an open source LLM-powered research tool. Code and other technical outputs associated with that work will be made available here.
