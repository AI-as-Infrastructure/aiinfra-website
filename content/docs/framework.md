Our primary goal is to produce a test harness and framework for the assessment of historical research tools powered by Large Language Models (LLM), prioritising scholarly and Indigenous values. A significant amount of this work will involve horizon scanning of existing best practices currently being developed across the research, GLAM, and commercial sectors. Versions of the framework will be listed here as they appear.
