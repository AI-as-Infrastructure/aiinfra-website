## Governance 

AIINFRA is a small project with lean governance. The project is coordinated from the ANU, with oversight from an Advisory Board that will meet as required. A Cultural Co-Creativity Consultant (Australia) and Indigenous Consultant (Aotearoa / New Zealand) guide Indigenous aspects of the project. An international Expert User Group will test the prototype and be offered opportunities to review the test harness and framework.
