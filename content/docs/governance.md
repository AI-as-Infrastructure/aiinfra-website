## Governance 

AIINFRA is a small project with lean governance. The project is coordinated from the ANU, with oversight from an Advisory Board that will meet as required. An Indigenous Consultant (Aotearoa / New Zealand) informs cultural aspects of the project. An international Expert User Group will test the evaluation framework and technical test harness.
